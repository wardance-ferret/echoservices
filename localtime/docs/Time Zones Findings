new API key: AIzaSyAHRHmmRyFwIw2CeQ6DriysZzX0oWFNNMM

(the key used for prediction api)

API manager lets you pick one of three kinds of credentials:

1) API key

   (key is used to identify my project, to check quota and access)
   Same key I used for Prediction API can be used for TZAPI

2) OAuth client ID
	
	(requests user consent so your app can access the user data)

3) Service account key
