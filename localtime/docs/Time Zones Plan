"Time Zones and Zoom Research - Sprint.  No implementation!"
----------
Sprint (May 1 - )

Time Zones
----------
There exists a remote partner in Alaska, they want time zones
and do not want zoom.  Think of +/- hrs W of Mountain Time (or some origin).
Zoom implementation is slightly less pressing than TZ, because of Alaska.

Story in EA-640

Users should see session times in their local time.
Hubs no TZs


Zoom Integration
----------------

Story in EA-666

Staff should appear distinct from "ItSupport" in the lists
Coordinator, Specialist, IT Support can start a meeting (start "zoom" button in their program, in a delta time around the meeting start.)
(join button for al others)
when the start button is pressed then everybody except the starter sees join

ItSupport has identical permissions from Staff except for adding participant.
(The slides on Zoom Int design are stored with the story) 

Jonathan will create a separate ticket for the new role ITSupport.

Zoom API
--------
-create users
-create meeting
-every meeting has host
 can enable people to start meeting without the host
 (we don't want that)
-co host (can mute or record)
-alternative host

-every meeting has a password 
  but pw rarely changed
  An 'Edit Clinic' panel will show the Clinic Capacity, TZ, Zoom ID, password change password will need to be changed through the API

-we will *not* be granting zoom account passwords  (zoom accts cost $15/mo) (Jonathan)
 there will be a single service account I guess? -Eric

(Stored with the story) 
Jody took some notes on how Zoom gets used -> will add to the tickets

Can hosting for meeting be transferred to a new user?
When participant joins a meeting, member profile info will update acct

Usability review for FE
------------------------
David will have plenty to do, might be too soon to even come up with a mock API the BE needs to fulfill.  Sarah has tested little on mobile devices.

Goal
----

1st week of September: 600-800 people come to metaECHO conference at Abq Conv Center.  Jonathan will give an update.

Over summer (May-August) go into beta testing w/features(and what else??)  

Jonathan's feature preview:
---------------------------
-Zoom integration
-TZ
-Simple exporting of spreadsheet as data
(later we'll tweak for time ranges, filters on the data)
-Technical debt pay down
-Cover photos (person avatar) has FE issues with cropping images, also BE issues with storage and providing image handles.
-File upload will handle recommendations (NO MORE TEXT RECS!)(so the same permissions for case prez would apply to recs)

EA-640 (MAY 1 snapshot)
======
As a Clinic Coordinator, I need to schedule a clinic session [in the local time where the hub is located]. If I'm traveling and in a different timezone than where the Clinic is based, I should be able to schedule a session and be sure that it is going to happen at the right time I expect. 

As a Participant, I need to see when the clinic sessions are scheduled for  - in MY time zone, no matter where I am in the world. 

Most of all I need to know with certainty when time a clinic session will happen, no ambiguity or uncertainty about timezones or Daylight Savings. 

 

Acceptance Criteria:
 * Everywhere in the Clinic feed where a session time is displayed, there must be a label identifying the TZ  (e.g. 10:00AM - 11:30AM PDT)
 * Our system automatically detects the user's timezone from their browser, so they don't have to set it. 
 * User should be able to see in User Settings what their timezone is, and manually change it (e.g. when traveling).
 * We will automatically adjust a user's timezone to manage Daylight Savings (e.g. change from MST to MDT).  
 * User should see clinic session times displayed in their own TZ
 * Clinic must have its own Location, which is chosen at the time of clinic creation. This informs the Timezone.
 * CC's can edit the location of the clinic, in case it changes, or the TZ is somehow incorrect. 
 * When scheduling a session, the Clinic Coordinator must see the time the Clinic Timezone, not necessarily their personal timezone. e.g. a Coordinator in NM schedules a session for a NY clinic. In the scheduling window, they see EDT. In the feed they see it in MDT.

  

Daylight Savings - we have to adjust the user's timezones for Daylight Savings Time changes. Bad use case: time switches to DST, but a user's account doesn't, so then they see all times displayed in local standard time, not local DST, i.e. off by 1 hour. So we have to autodetect and correct for DST offset from UTC. Note: DST switch occurs in different times in different countries. 

Helpful list of timezones, with abbreviations and their UTC offsets: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_zone_abbreviations]
